#Synopsis of the project
This is a personal project based on a real mobile game that I play with some
of my friends and none of the information dealing with Star Wars is my property
nor do I own any of the rights to the actual star wars information in this
project. This is simply a side project that I wanted to develop to hone my 
development skills. I utilized the mobile game 'Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes' as
an inspiration as something I have a lot of information about and was able to
use as a template for a coding project.
